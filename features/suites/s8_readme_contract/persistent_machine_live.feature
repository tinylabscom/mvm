Feature: README persistent machine lifecycle works end to end

  The hermetic README contract proves these commands still parse. This narrow
  live witness proves the documented persistent-machine path actually operates
  one real microVM without paying for every registry, Nix, and bundle example.

  @live @firecracker @ci_live
  Scenario: the documented persistent machine path operates a real guest
    Given an isolated mvm home on encrypted backing storage
    When I run mvmctl in the isolated mvm home with "machine create bdd-readme-web --image nginx --cpus 2 --memory 512M"
    Then the command exits with code 0
    When I run mvmctl in an isolated live home with "machine start bdd-readme-web"
    Then the command exits with code 0
    When I run mvmctl in the isolated mvm home with "machine exec bdd-readme-web -- nginx -v"
    Then the command exits with code 0
    When I run mvmctl in the isolated mvm home with "machine logs bdd-readme-web"
    Then the command exits with code 0
    When I run mvmctl in the isolated mvm home with "machine inspect bdd-readme-web"
    Then the command exits with code 0
    When I run mvmctl in the isolated mvm home with "machine stop bdd-readme-web --yes"
    Then the command exits with code 0
    When I run mvmctl in the isolated mvm home with "machine rm bdd-readme-web --yes"
    Then the command exits with code 0
