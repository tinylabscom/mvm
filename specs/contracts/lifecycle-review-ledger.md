# Lifecycle and unsafe review: reviewed to date (umbrella #4839)

Backing: preview
Validation: none — this records what was read and what was fixed, as stated in the fixing PRs; it is not a claim that the review is exhaustive and enforces nothing beyond the `undocumented_unsafe_blocks` lint it cites.

The umbrella issue owns status. This file records the "reviewed to date" half of the box
"Review ownership, allocation, errors, state transitions, cancellation, lock/task ownership,
cleanup/rollback, unsafe/FFI boundaries, and panic paths affected by changes" in
[#4839](https://github.com/tinylabscom/mvm/issues/4839). The ongoing half is the PR checklist item in
`AGENTS.md` ("Definition of Done", item 7).

**The review is not exhaustive.** The tables list the areas read, the defects they produced, and,
separately, the files that were not read. Absence from the "read" column is not evidence of
soundness. "Read" is taken from the fixing PR descriptions and the review notes for the lane; the
line ranges are as recorded there and were not re-derived when this file was written.

## Mechanical gate

`clippy::undocumented_unsafe_blocks` is `deny` workspace-wide ([#5438](https://github.com/tinylabscom/mvm/pull/5438);
about 200 `SAFETY` comments were written after reading each site, and three packages that had skipped
the lint table now inherit it). The earlier unsafe documentation pass for `mvm-setpriv` and
`mvm-host-services` is [#4993](https://github.com/tinylabscom/mvm/pull/4993). The lint checks that a
comment exists, not that its claim is true; the sites were read, but a comment is not a proof.

## Reviewed areas and defects fixed

| Area reviewed | Defect class | Fixed in | Files read and found sound or fixed |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Silent `let _ =` on teardown and rollback paths | cleanup failure discarded | [#4989](https://github.com/tinylabscom/mvm/pull/4989) | builder pipeline teardown, transient-run Ctrl-C handler, Firecracker `teardown_paused` restore branches, idle-pool claim rollback (`crates/mvm-backends/src/fc/idle_pool.rs`) |
| Production `unwrap` on guaranteed values | panic path encoded in types | [#4992](https://github.com/tinylabscom/mvm/pull/4992) | `embed_toolchain::strip_glibc`, stage0 nix-seed lift, `vm artifact` prefix resolution, TypeScript decorator site scan, manifest image validation |
| Panics and truncation on hostile sizes | arithmetic overflow, narrowing casts, lock poisoning | [#5168](https://github.com/tinylabscom/mvm/pull/5168) | `mvm-fs` ext4 writer and `elf.rs`; cpio writer in `mvm-builder-guest`; `mvm-agentd/src/process_rpc.rs` and `mvm-core` instance metrics locks. Census is heuristic (script, not a parser) |
| Unproven `expect`/`unwrap` in six crates | panic path | [#5352](https://github.com/tinylabscom/mvm/pull/5352) | `mvm-fs`, `mvm-net`, `mvm-client`, `mvm-bundler`, `mvm-http`, `mvm-hostd`; poisoned-mutex expects and static schema parses left alone on purpose |
| Other typed-error conversions | panic path | [#5075](https://github.com/tinylabscom/mvm/pull/5075), [#5083](https://github.com/tinylabscom/mvm/pull/5083), [#5139](https://github.com/tinylabscom/mvm/pull/5139) | empty workloads, bare image refs, unnamed persistent requests; agentd, vmm and hostd reachable panics; registry `block_on` bridge inside a tokio runtime |
| Persistent builder pid and kernel cache | signalling pid 0 (own process group); racy fixed staging name | [#5385](https://github.com/tinylabscom/mvm/pull/5385) | persistent-builder stop path, `extract_bundled_kernel` |
| Pid-file readers | corrupt pid file reaching `kill(2)` | [#5388](https://github.com/tinylabscom/mvm/pull/5388), [#5395](https://github.com/tinylabscom/mvm/pull/5395) | `EndpointPid::parse`, broker, audit-signer, network-endpoint, QEMU and GPU endpoint pid readers; one `signalable_pid` rule in `crates/mvm-vmm/src/host/process_liveness.rs` |
| Stale pid file at boot | boot proceeding past an unremovable pid file | [#4991](https://github.com/tinylabscom/mvm/pull/4991) | libkrun and QEMU boot paths |
| FlowMux registry and UDP relay | peer-chosen stream id overflow; unsolicited datagrams holding an association; UDP slot leak on open failure | [#5390](https://github.com/tinylabscom/mvm/pull/5390) | `crates/mvm-hostd/src/supervisor/flowmux/registry.rs`, `udp_relay.rs`. The slot-leak fix has no test (needs fd or thread exhaustion) |
| HVF guest PC, SMP unwind, HTTP flow cancellation | guest-chosen PC overflow; panic wedging `thread::scope`; cancellation unwatched after response head | [#5402](https://github.com/tinylabscom/mvm/pull/5402) | `crates/mvm-runtime/src/backends/hvf/smp.rs` (non-test code), `http_flow.rs`, `open_flow.rs` lines 1-352 |
| HVF snapshot and cancellation lifecycle | pause/capture races, completion notification | [#4994](https://github.com/tinylabscom/mvm/pull/4994), [#5064](https://github.com/tinylabscom/mvm/pull/5064), [#4983](https://github.com/tinylabscom/mvm/pull/4983) | fixed under the HVF owner work; not re-read for this table |
| Volume, checkpoint and peer-EOF custody | custody, removal guard, EOF after timeout refusal | [#4880](https://github.com/tinylabscom/mvm/pull/4880), [#4957](https://github.com/tinylabscom/mvm/pull/4957), [#4864](https://github.com/tinylabscom/mvm/pull/4864), [#4879](https://github.com/tinylabscom/mvm/pull/4879) | fixed under the volume and vmm owner work; not re-read for this table |
| Unsafe/FFI documentation | missing `SAFETY` claims | [#4993](https://github.com/tinylabscom/mvm/pull/4993), [#5438](https://github.com/tinylabscom/mvm/pull/5438) | every `unsafe` block in the workspace has a comment; see the gate above |

## Files NOT read

None of the following was read for lifecycle, ownership or cancellation defects. Treat them as
unreviewed.

- `crates/mvm-backends/src/driver/hvf_restore.rs` lines 1-380 and 620 to the end (the part between was read).
- Snapshot codecs: `crates/mvm-runtime/src/backends/hvf/snapshot.rs` and `crates/mvm-vmm/src/snapshot.rs`.
- `crates/mvm-runtime/src/backends/hvf/kernel_boot.rs`: most of `run_primary` and the device wiring.
- Tests in `crates/mvm-runtime/src/backends/hvf/smp.rs`.
- `crates/mvm-hostd/src/supervisor/flowmux/`: `ingress.rs`, `tcp_relay.rs`, `open_flow.rs` beyond line 352, `socket.rs`, `wire.rs`, `resources.rs`.
- `crates/mvm-backends/src/driver/libkrun.rs` configuration building.
- Async cancellation safety outside FlowMux.
- The volume bridge beyond its wire codec (`crates/mvm-agentd/src/volume.rs`, `crates/mvm-client/src/volume/`).

## Known and unfixed

Found during the #5390 review and left alone. No item has a fix in flight; the owner is the
maintainer of the named area until an issue is opened, and the next step is a failing-before test
at the cited site, then the fix.

| Item | Site | Owner | Next step |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `child.kill()` on boot timeout is never followed by `wait()` (zombie); same shape in other drivers | `crates/mvm-backends/src/driver/libkrun.rs` lines 340 and 369; also `driver/hvf/stop_state.rs`, `driver/hvf_restore.rs`, `fc/idle_pool.rs` | backends maintainer | add `wait()` after each kill with a test using a stub child; sweep the other sites |
| `await_restored` returns an error without killing the supervisor when the pid is negative or the agent socket is missing after the ready marker | `crates/mvm-backends/src/driver/hvf_restore.rs` (`await_restored`) | HVF restore owner | kill and reap on every error return; test with a ready marker and no socket |
| `hvf/standby.rs` leaves the VM running when its pid is negative | `crates/mvm-backends/src/driver/hvf/standby.rs` | HVF owner | refuse and stop through the owned-stop path; test with a negative pid |
| `HvfVm::create` does not destroy the VM or release the GIC config when GIC creation fails | `crates/mvm-runtime/src/backends/hvf/hv_impl.rs` (`HvfVm::create`) | HVF owner | release on the error path; needs a fault-injection seam on the GIC call, so a live HVF host or a seam first |
| FlowMux registry keeps `Closed` entries for the session lifetime (memory only, rate-limited) | `crates/mvm-hostd/src/supervisor/flowmux/registry.rs` | hostd maintainer | evict closed entries on a bound; test that a long session does not grow without limit |
