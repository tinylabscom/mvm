# Refactor status

Last updated: 2026-07-31

This is the cross-plan progress index. The owning plan remains authoritative
for detailed scope and acceptance criteria.

## In-flight plans
- [x] Plan 282 — Merge queue auto-requeue
      (`specs/plans/282-merge-queue-auto-requeue.md`)
  - [x] Refuse conflicts and bound retry attempts per PR
  - [x] Keep privileged execution on the trusted base ref with no checkout
  - [x] Complete repository validation and queue the PR

- [x] Plan 270 — Universal initramfs + vsock-activated boot
      (`specs/plans/270-universal-initramfs-vsock-activated-boot.md`)
  - [x] Core boot contract: `ActivateEnvironment` over the authenticated
        vsock session, `ActivationState` gate, PID-1 agent with mount
        library + uid-901 drop (#1914)
  - [x] Runner/driver adoption: QEMU unified runner (#1931), Docker
        dev-tier (#1933), Wasm activation (#1936), Apple Container kernel
        on HVF (#1968)
  - [x] Activation agent-readiness retry on the wire (#1985)
  - [x] Deterministic cargo initramfs replaces the Nix initramfs build
        (#1996); attestation stays the content hash + sidecar contract
  - [~] Deviations recorded at the unticked steps in the plan: capability-bit
        negotiation, chain-signed boot events, and vm_id/session binding were
        superseded by the path discriminator + session-key pinning; the
        guest-side activation idle timeout and focused zombie-reaping tests
        remain open

- [~] Plan 271 — Apple Container backend
      (`specs/plans/271-apple-container-backend.md`)
  - [x] Kernel artifact resolution + thin HVF-runner delegation shipped
        (#1968): Apple's prebuilt container kernel boots the same universal
        initramfs on the HVF runner; 100% Rust-native, `check-no-vz` guard
  - [x] Hermetic BDD coverage for the backend contract (#1996)
  - [ ] Live e2e validation with a real fetched kernel, then the
        claim-by-claim security-profile review (plan's stage 2)

- [ ] Plan 279 — Build action identity and a real artifact manifest
      (`specs/plans/279-build-action-identity-and-artifact-manifest.md`)
  - [ ] WS1 — `ActionDigest` into the identity taxonomy (land after plan 276 WS6)
  - [ ] WS2 — `ArtifactManifest`: mode, xattrs, symlinks, hard links; one walk
        shared with the ext4 materializer
  - [ ] WS3 — Bind action → artifact, host-signed, into the chain-signed log
  - [ ] WS4 — Decision gate: measure, then decide the fetch/build network split
  - [x] Prerequisite, landed separately: narrow the nix workspace filter to an
        allow-list so a docs-only edit stops invalidating every guest binary
        (416 of 1872 files, 22%, stop being cache keys)

- [~] Plan 265 — Fast-start SLO, backend sequencing & competitive positioning
  (`specs/plans/265-fast-start-slo-sequencing-positioning.md`)
  - [x] WS1 — Finish the FC warm-restore story (no-NIC guard, real
        `FirecrackerIO`, un-bailed warm restore, teardown on refusal)
  - [x] WS2 — The ≤30 ms p50 SLO: native API client, `api_put_socket`
        privilege verdict, pooled/pre-staged FC saved-state claim, and live
        KVM-box measurements recorded in the plan. SLO not cleared; remaining
        ~5–6 ms gap is Firecracker process startup + snapshot resume.

- [x] Plan 273 — SDK sidecar release acquisition
  (`specs/plans/273-sdk-sidecar-release-acquisition.md`)
  - [x] Publish `sdk-sidecar-<arch>.tar.gz` per-arch release assets, with
        `tests/release_assets.rs` pinning the workflow's names to the Rust
        constructor that requests them
  - [x] `mvm_build::sdk_sidecar` fetch + integrity-verify + atomic install,
        reusing the runtime overlay's transport helpers and one generalized
        archive-entry validator
  - [x] Reach it from the launch path on the download-mode acquire path; a
        source checkout keeps the fail-closed refusal

- [x] Plan 277 — release-artifact signature verification
  (`specs/plans/277-release-artifact-signature-verification.md`)
  - [x] Sign the image tarballs with `--new-bundle-format`, the only shape the
        in-binary Rust verifier parses; binary tarballs stay legacy for the
        cosign-CLI consumers (`install.sh`, `mvmctl update`)
  - [x] `mvm_build::release_signature` — fetch the bundle, verify against the
        versioned release identity, fail closed with no digest-only downgrade
  - [x] Wire the rung into both download paths, before extraction
  - [x] Docs + rollup; closes plan 273's one deferred gap

- [x] Plan 266 — lightweight microVM guest
  (`specs/plans/266-lightweight-microvm-guest.md`)
  - [x] WS-1/WS-2: static-musl privilege drop via the in-house `mvm-setpriv`
  - [x] WS-3: static-musl runtime overlay with the glibc SDK FFI split out
  - [x] WS-3 follow-up: plan-driven automatic SDK-sidecar attachment, gated
        fail-closed on the shared admission path
  - [x] WS-4: capability-negotiated guest-agent RSS query + 8 MiB ceiling
  - [x] WS-5/WS-6: lean kernel-module metadata, re-minimized immutable ext4, and
        the unified footprint ledger against the literal 50,000,000-byte contract
        with the optional SDK sidecar reported separately

- [x] Plan 280 — transcript root audit binding
  (`specs/plans/280-transcript-root-audit-binding.md`)
  - [x] Version-2 manifest root over fixed metadata and ordered ciphertext
        chunk records, with deterministic and mutation coverage
  - [x] Ordered `gateway.transcript_sealed` emission after atomic manifest
        persistence, chain-signed through the existing per-VM signer
  - [x] Exact tenant audit-chain anchor required before transcript key unwrap
        and decryption, with hermetic operator-path BDD coverage

- [~] Plan 255 — vsock-first snapshot, egress, and warm-start adoption
  (`specs/plans/255-vsock-first-snapshot-egress-adoption.md`)
  - [x] Snapshot storage and lineage-protected clone primitives
  - [x] Template-scoped warm-parent reservation and memory bounds
  - [x] QEMU Stage 0 raw-egress proof on the FC host
  - [x] Linux regression coverage for concurrent raw-egress handlers
  - [x] Final-child verb grant issuance, validation, persistence, and
        PostRestore delivery without granting authority to the parent
  - [x] Persistent-machine Firecracker stop fails closed and preserves state
        until process exit is verified (#2007; live KVM recheck passed)
  - [~] Live warm-launch, fork-isolation, and restore-clock verification
  - [ ] Typed-connector egress-policy enrichment
  - [ ] OCI-image template build path and CLI facade completion
