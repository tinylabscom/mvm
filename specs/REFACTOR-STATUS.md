PLAN 129 — Secrets / SigV4 substitution         🟢 clean-room recipe e2e GREEN on QEMU 2026-06-11 (secret set → build compile → up → invoke --attach; httpbin reflects the real key, guest holds placeholder only); SDK-free http terminator (#735/#744) + Stage 2 https/name-constrained-CA (#761) landed; FC boots (#793) but its egress leg is blocked: endpoint spawn is qemu-only (`should_thread_signed_plan`) + FC flake-kernel gap — see plan §"Deferred follow-ups"

      (mechanism corrected: FC=TAP+nft NAT, not passt/skuid; passt path deferred to libkrun)
  [ ] live SDK-free FC box e2e — Task 6 — clean-room recipe e2e ran 2026-06-11
      (prompt: specs/prompts/129-fc-bringup-debug.md). QEMU leg GREEN end-to-end:
      `secret set` → `build compile` (artifacts clean of the value) → `up`
      (endpoint spawned, guest env = placeholder only) → `invoke --attach`
      (httpbin reflects `Bearer REALKEY-…`, the real credential). FC leg: boots
      (#793) but spawns NO endpoint — `should_thread_signed_plan` threads the
      plan onto the backend config only for qemu, so FC never sees plan_json;
      plus mkGuest flake builds emit no vmlinux and the FC boot path assumes
      `{build_dir}/vmlinux` (hand-staged bzImage as box workaround). Both
      recorded as plan-129 deferred follow-ups, with two more: the spawned
      endpoint runs without the audit Recorder (no `secret.substituted` entry
      in a live run), and `invoke`'s empty-stdin default violates the
      `[args, kwargs]` wire contract.
  [x] Stage 2 S2.1–S2.6: name-constrained per-VM CA (crypto::egress_ca) + host
      cert/key split + kernel-cmdline cert + placeholder-env delivery (mvm.egress_ca /
      mvm.secret_env) + SNI-gated TLS terminator (terminate bound / splice unbound,
      reqwest re-origination) + :443 nft redirect + ADR-006 Accepted / ADR-067

  [ ] Stage 2 S2.7: live SDK-free https FC box e2e — gated on the FC bringup above
      (agent reachability) + a placeholder-env-at-boot path (resolved by Approach A
      in #761; box-validation pending)
  [x] Python `mvm.secret(type=,hosts=)` egress surface + retire `_runtime.py` — PR #722
  [x] TS `secret()` egress + retire `runtime.ts` + docs .mdx  — PR #723
  [x] secret-egress example workload (examples/python/secret-egress)
  [x] Phase E: undeclared secret/PII egress redact-to-XXX detector
      (RedactingSubstitution mask-and-continue; PiiRedactor/SecretsScanner
      redact()) wired always-on into the gateway bridge — PR #733
  [x] Phase E uniform coverage: same RedactingSubstitution wired into the
      per-VM substitution endpoint (request-level), so every backend routing
      egress through it scrubs identically; claim-13 `secret.redacted` audit
  [x] local secret-workload launch (mvm's domain): compile strips SecretRef
      from the baked image + emits workload.json; `up --flake <dir>`
      auto-discovers it → lowers plan.secrets → admits → endpoint spawn.
      Fixed: main `up` path only threaded the signed plan to the backend under
      MVM_GATEWAY_BRIDGE=1, so the QEMU endpoint never spawned — now QEMU
      threads it unconditionally (libkrun/Vz stay flag-gated)
  [x] box-validated on QEMU (dev-kvm): secret-free image (launch.env={}),
      guest holds ONLY the placeholder (substitution-env.json), endpoint
      spawns at boot + is reaped on `down`
  [x] `invoke <name> --attach` dispatches RunEntrypoint into the running `up`
      workload (reuses endpoint + placeholders); function body runs with the
      injected proxy+placeholder env
  [x] guest loopback made functional → PR #749: netinit must not blackhole its
      own `lo` (EINVAL) AND /init must bring `lo` up (ENETUNREACH) — both were
      broken, killing the forward proxy. The two together complete the loopback
  [x] FULL live-guest e2e CLOSED on QEMU (#745+#749+#755): destination (httpbin)
      reflects "Authorization: Bearer REALKEY-…" (REAL credential) while the guest
      holds only mvm-secret-… — workload→loopback proxy→guest-host vsock→endpoint
      substitute→real http forward→echo. "A raw secret never enters the microVM"
      proven end-to-end on a live guest
  [x] SSRF resolver port-443 bug FIXED → PR #755: forwarder resolves+SSRF-filters
      itself, pins the safe IPs on the URL's real port (resolve_to_addrs). This
      closed the e2e (http forwards no longer hit :443). web_fetch/MCP unaffected
  [~] ephemeral serverless `invoke <artifact>` (boot_session_vm through admission
      + endpoint) — HOST SIDE DONE: `invoke --from-workload-ir <ir>` lowers the
      workload's secrets + admits a plan inside boot_session_vm (closure seam) so
      the backend spawns the substitution endpoint; QEMU reads plan_json directly.
      Box e2e + FC plan.json stash are the remaining (box-gated) follow-ups
  E1 Step 2 — per-destination egress PII + entropy redaction (design approved
      2026-06-10, specs/notes/plan-129-e1-step2-pii-entropy-redaction-design.md;
      no ML/NER — anchored+gazetteer names; scoped to cleartext vsock endpoint)
    [x] design + honest threat-model framing (hygiene layer, not a boundary)
    [x] slice 1: EntropyScanner (Shannon entropy, audit-first, no echo)
    [x] slice 2: IBAN (mod-97) added to structured PII set
    [x] slice 3: name detector (field-label + PII co-occurrence + gazetteer)
    [x] slice 4: RedactionAction + redaction_profiles + resolve (mvm-core)
    [x] slice 5: destination-aware wiring; fail-closed over-cap/compressed bodies
    [x] admission carriage: redaction rides inline in signed ExecutionPlan →
        redaction_from_signed_json → backend EndpointConfig → from_plan →
        with_redaction_policy (a plan carrying redaction flows end-to-end);
        consume per-dest pii/secrets disposition (no longer RESERVED)
    [x] CLI authoring: `mvmctl up --redact HOST[=audit]` parses a per-destination
        RedactionPolicy → SynthesisInput → synthesize_plan sets ExecutionPlan.redaction
    [x] enriched always-on default secret list: +17 high-precision vendor token
        shapes (gitlab/fine-grained-PAT/stripe-test+restricted/sendgrid/npm/pypi/
        square/shopify/digitalocean/vault/postman/linear/figma/google-oauth/
        slack-webhook) in SecretsScanner DEFAULT_RULES — anchored prefixes, low-FP,
        masked on ALL egress by default (no flag). JWT deliberately excluded (legit bearer).
    [x] terminator-path redaction + fail-closed + audit (typed TerminatorError;
        both :80/:443 cores; adversarial fail-closed tests + security review)
    [x] live PII spans for name co-occurrence: PiiRedactor::match_spans threaded
        into NameScanner on the live redact_bytes_for path (names run pre-PII-mask)
    [ ] remaining: IR/SDK developer-declared authoring (descoped — CLI --redact +
        mvmd bundle cover it). See plan §"Deferred follow-ups".
  [x] Phase F: egress no-secret-to-guest leak-gate (claim-12/13 backstop) —
      canary tests (handed_placeholders_never_contain_the_secret_value /
      substitution_endpoint_refuses_unbound_destination /
      audit_chain_carries_no_secret_value) in crates/mvm-hostd/tests/
      egress_secret_leak_gate.rs + claim doc claim-egress-no-secret-to-guest.md +
      catalog.md row 16 witnesses (Preview), gated on every PR (Test lane +
      check-claim-catalog)
  [x] substitution-endpoint jailer wrap: self-applied Landlock + seccomp-BPF
      (ConfinementSpec::substitution_endpoint — store dirs + TLS/DNS read-only,
      BRIDGE_SYSCALLS + tokio/rustls additions), fail-closed before serving the
      first guest byte; macOS stub no-op. Allowlist completeness box-validated
      (Linux runtime check) like the firecracker-bridge confinement
  [ ] forward proxy https/CONNECT (only http/absolute-form works today) — deferred
  [x] forward-path signing integration (SigV4 + HMAC)  — prepare_request branches
      on the resolved auth_type, routes SigV4/HMAC through the bind-checked
      endpoint.sign (claim 12, key-never-leaves) and assembles the
      Authorization (AWS4-HMAC-SHA256) / x-mvm-signature header. Credential
      model: the secret value IS the secret-access-key (in the encrypted store,
      the signing key); access_key_id/region/service are non-secret operator
      metadata on the binding (mvmctl secret set --type sigv4
      --aws-access-key-id/--region/--service) reconstructed onto the SecretRef
      at admission. Security tests: sigv4_request_gets_a_valid_authorization_header,
      sigv4_forward_path_matches_the_aws_get_vanilla_signature,
      sigv4_unbound_destination_is_refused_before_signing,

PLAN 183 — Builder-VM egress posture + net boot 🔴 diagnosed; plan landed
  Diagnosis proven 2026-06-11 (controlled A/B in one dev-up run: Stage 0
  fetched the full closure; the builder VM minutes later could not resolve):
  boot-time install_egress_lockdown (OUTPUT DROP, proxy-uid-only) applies to
  the whole builder VM and drops every nix fetch — active since iptables-legacy
  landed (f184b17d, 2026-06-05); the dev-tier skip is QEMU-only. Plus: Vz
  builder gets no DHCP lease (eth0 unconfigured), and /etc/resolv.conf is a
  read-only baked file so leased DNS never lands.

  trust audit→cmd.audit, …) so claims 8/12/13 event names unchanged.
  Deferred dir-purity: dev/doctor/init modules still live in env/.

PLAN 180 — Strip spec refs from code comments    ✅ DONE
  [x] worklist + canonical detection regex (494 files / ~3,097 line-hits baseline)
  [x] pilot batch (7 heaviest files)
  [x] fan-out sweep — comment-only; ~1,000+ citations removed across ~280 files
      (string literals / wire data / `claim N` security-property names kept)
  [x] verify comment-only diff + workspace build green
  [x] check-no-spec-refs-in-comments lint gate (string-aware: skips raw
      strings; exempts the two self-referential lint files) wired into the
      Lint CI job

PLAN 181 — App-builder product surface           🔴 NOT STARTED  (ADR-079; mvm primitive ↔ mvmd product per ADR-070)
  [ ] WS-A preview ingress: published-ports model (signed in plan) + per-port
      routing label at gateway seam + wake-on-access VmBackend hook + local
      single-machine dev ingress (s-<id>-<port>.preview.localhost)
  [ ] WS-B lifecycle verbs: vm stop (free RAM, wake-on-access) / rm (keep
      workspace) / purge (delete workspace) / keepalive (extend idle TTL);
      workspace-data lifecycle in mvm_core::config; distinct cmd.* audit events
  [ ] WS-C task/files protocol: async streamable task over agent-RPC (169) reusing
      ExecEvent (172) + SSE-ready event shape + Files API parity on fs RPC + thin
      mvmctl verbs (agent-agnostic; mvmd owns HTTP/SSE transport)
  [ ] WS-D install DX: curl|sh installer (folds Plan 159 WS-5 D) + "next steps"
      output (endpoint + preview URLs + runnable cmds) + graduated env uninstall
      (--images/--data/--all; keep-workspaces default)
  NOTE: deliberately rejects the sibling app-builder's isolation model — no Docker
  socket, no host-path mounts into a workload, no auth-off/caps-off defaults, no
  baked-in agents, no multi-tenant HTTP/auth in mvm (mvmd per ADR-070 §5/Plan 33).
```

## Security claims

15/15 shipped, none regressed, + 1 `Preview` (claim 16, egress-substitution
leak-gate — witnesses machine-checked, ADR-002 promotion pending) (`specs/claims/catalog.md`,
gated by `xtask check-claim-catalog`).
