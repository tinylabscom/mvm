title: "ADR-002: microVM security posture — explicit guarantees, layered defenses"
status: Proposed
date: 2026-04-30
supersedes: none
related: ADR-001 (multi-backend execution); plan 25-microvm-hardening
---

## Status

Proposed. Implementation tracked in `specs/plans/25-microvm-hardening.md`.

## Context

mvm runs untrusted-shaped Linux workloads in microVMs. Through Sprint
14 the project's stated security model was a single claim: "no SSH in
microVMs, ever — vsock-only communication, with the dev `Exec` handler
gated at compile time by the `dev-shell` Cargo feature." That claim is
true and load-bearing, but it is the *only* hardened layer. Everything
underneath it — the guest's own privilege model, the rootfs's integrity,
the host-side proxy socket, the supply chain by which the dev image
arrives, the deserializer that parses every host-to-guest message — is
soft. A failure in any one of those defeats the whole stack regardless
of the vsock claim.

The project's value proposition is that a developer can run third-party
or AI-generated code in a microVM and trust the isolation. That promise
demands that the protections be technical, verifiable, and stated
explicitly.

This ADR captures the decisions; the implementation sequence is in
`specs/plans/25-microvm-hardening.md`.

## Threat model

Adversaries, in priority order:

1. **A malicious guest workload.** Code running inside a microVM. Must
   not be able to read the host filesystem outside explicit shares,
   talk to the host network, escape the hypervisor, read another
   guest service's secrets, or tamper with the rootfs's baked closure.

2. **A same-host hostile process.** Another local user, or another
   process running as the host user, must not be able to talk to the
   dev VM's guest agent, read its console log, write to its rootfs
   cache, or tamper with launchd plists / GC roots.

3. **A compromised supply chain.** A malicious nixpkgs commit, a
   compromised GitHub account hosting prebuilt artifacts, or a
   typo-squatted Cargo dep, must not silently land code in a microVM
   without producing a verifiable signature failure.

A *malicious host* (the macOS or Linux machine running mvmctl itself)
is **explicitly out of scope**. mvmctl trusts the host with the
hypervisor, the GC roots, the launchd plists, the user's secrets in
`/mnt/secrets`, and the private build keys.

## Surfaces

A complete enumeration of every surface that bears on these adversaries.
Each is addressed in the corresponding workstream of plan 25.

### Host → guest

| Surface | Today | Hardened |
|---|---|---|
| Vsock framing in `mvm-guest-agent` | `serde_json::from_slice`, no fuzzing, parses any `GuestRequest` | `deny_unknown_fields`, depth/size caps, fuzzed in CI (W4.1, W4.2) |
| `Exec` handler | Compile-gated by `dev-shell` feature, but no CI gate | CI greps the prod binary for `do_exec`; absence is enforced (W4.3) |
| `ConsoleOpen` | PTY data port multiplexed over vsock | Same; mitigated by per-service uid (W2.1) and proxy-socket lockdown (W1.2, W1.3) |
| `StartPortForward` bind address | Not audited | Asserted `127.0.0.1`-only by regression test (W4.4) |
| Guest agent's own privileges | Runs as PID 1 = uid 0 | Runs as uid 901 `mvm-agent` user under `setpriv` (W4.5) |

### Guest → host

| Surface | Today | Hardened |
|---|---|---|
| VirtioFS workdir share | Writable, scoped to project dir | Unchanged shape, but per-service uid means no service can write there without explicit user grant (W2.1) |
| VirtioFS datadir share | Writable, scoped to `~/.mvm` | Same; mode-locked containment via uid + `nosuid,nodev` mount opts (W2.3) |
| Host-side proxy socket | Mode inherits umask (typ. 0755) | Mode `0700` post-bind (W1.2) |
| Vsock proxy port-forward | Any port allowed | Allowlist: 52 + `PORT_FORWARD_BASE..+65535` (W1.3) |
| Console log + daemon log | Mode inherits umask | Mode `0600` (W1.4) |
| Block device passthrough | `nix-store.img` attached as `/dev/vdb`; host doesn't mount it | Documented invariant: host shall never `mount` this file. Static-check in code review. |

### Inside the guest

| Surface | Today | Hardened |
|---|---|---|
| Service privilege model | All services run as uid 900 in shared `serviceGroup` | Per-service uid, per-service group, mode-0400 secrets (W2.1) |
| `/etc/{passwd,group,nsswitch}` | Tmpfs-writable at runtime | Bind-mounted read-only after init (W2.2) |
| Service launch privileges | busybox `su -s sh -c …` | `setpriv --no-new-privs --bounding-set=-all --groups=<gid>,900` (W2.3) |
| Per-service syscall filtering | None (default tier `unrestricted`) | Default tier `standard`; per-service overrideable (W1.1, W2.4) |
| Rootfs integrity | None | dm-verity over the read-only ext4 lower layer; root hash on cmdline (W3.1-W3.4) |
| Capabilities | Inherited bounding set | Empty bounding set per service (W2.3) |

### Supply chain

| Surface | Today | Hardened |
|---|---|---|
| Pre-built dev image | HTTPS download, no integrity check beyond TLS | SHA-256 verified against const compiled into mvmctl (W5.1) |
| Cargo deps | No audit | `cargo-deny` + `cargo-audit` in CI; pre-commit local check (W5.2) |
| mvmctl binary reproducibility | Not verified | Double-build hash check in CI (W5.3) |
| SBOM | Not emitted | CycloneDX SBOM attached to releases (W5.4) |
| nixpkgs trust | `cache.nixos.org` trusted via `trusted-public-keys` | Inherited assumption; documented but not changed |
| Linux builder SSH | `sudo cp` writes `/etc/ssh/ssh_config.d/200-linux-builder.conf` | Documented; user-level prompt before sudo |

## Decisions

The following are decided and committed for v1 of this hardening:

1. **Defaults must be safe.** Every option whose value affects security
   defaults to the safer choice, and users opt *out* with documentation.
   No more `seccomp = unrestricted` defaults; no more `0755` socket
   defaults.

2. **Defense in depth, not a single chokepoint.** The vsock-only claim
   stays load-bearing, but every layer beneath it is also tightened.
   A failure in any one layer must not be catastrophic.

3. **Verified boot is mandatory for production microVMs.** The dev VM
   is exempt because its overlay-upper write layer can't compose with
   dm-verity; that exemption is named explicitly so the dev VM is
   never used as a "production microVM" by accident.

4. **The guest agent does not run as root in production.** Period. It
   doesn't need to, and the day-zero exploit cost of "uid 0 + buggy
   deser" is too high to keep paying.

5. **CI gates the security claims.** Every claim made in this ADR is
   backed by a CI check that fails the build if the claim is no
   longer true. Specifically: `cargo-deny`, `cargo-audit`, the `do_exec`
   symbol grep, the seccomp regression test, the proxy-socket perm
   test, the verity round-trip test, the bind-address test. Listed in
   plan 25 §W6.

6. **The threat model is documented and lived-with.** A malicious host
   is out of scope. Multi-tenant guests are out of scope. Hardware-
   backed key attestation is out of scope. These limits are in the
   ADR so we don't accidentally commit to defending against them.

## Consequences

### Positive

- The vsock-only claim becomes one of seven enforced claims, each with
  CI evidence.
- The dev VM's "trust mvmctl entirely" model is now an *explicit choice*
  the codebase makes, not a side-effect of missing layers.
- New contributors get a clear story: "here's what mvm protects against,
  here's what it doesn't, here's how each protection is enforced."

### Negative / accepted costs

- The production guest closure grows by ~1.5 MB to include
  `pkgs.util-linux` (for `setpriv`/`runuser`).
- dm-verity adds a second VirtioBlk device per VM and a few hundred
  ms to first-boot setup.
- `cargo-deny`/`cargo-audit` in CI will occasionally block merges on
  upstream advisories. This is the *point*; we accept the friction.
- Per-service uid means existing example flakes need a one-line audit
  to confirm they don't rely on the shared `serviceGroup` for cross-
  service file sharing. (None observed today.)

### Explicit non-goals

- **Malicious host defense.** Out of scope. Documented.
- **Multi-tenant guests.** Out of scope.
- **TPM/SEV/attestation.** Out of scope for v1.
- **Network policy enforcement at hypervisor level.** The
  `network_policy` field exists in `mvm-core` and the seccomp tier
  filters network syscalls, but the hypervisor itself doesn't enforce
  guest egress destinations beyond NAT vs. tap. Noted, not addressed
  in this ADR; potential follow-up.

## Reversal cost

If a later decision wants to undo a layer (e.g. roll back per-service
uid because of a use case we didn't foresee):

- W1 items are one-line patches; trivially reversible.
- W2 items change the init contract; reversal requires a flake-API
  version bump because user flakes can become uid-aware.
- W3 (verity) is the biggest commitment; reversing means dropping the
  "rootfs integrity" claim from the security posture, which would
  warrant its own superseding ADR.
- W4-W5 items are CI/test additions; trivially reversible if they
  prove too noisy.
